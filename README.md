# Gratibox-front

Hello my dear user, here you can find the frontend of the gratibox project.

What we wanted with this project was a basic registration to signatures app.

As you may find, it's a very simple one.

So, let's begin:

First, clone this repository to your machine.

After you have done that, you only need a few more steps, here they are:

1 - go to the .env.example.js and change the string to your port (it's the same one you used in the backend), save it in a .env.js archive.
2 - run the "npm i" command to get all modules.
3 - run the "npm start" command.

And done, now our project is running in your machine.

You can find our backend part of the project here -> https://github.com/MarcioVCunha/Gratibox-Back
